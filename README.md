# ATM-INTERFACE

This project simulates an ATM (Automated Teller Machine) system that allows users to perform various banking operations such as withdrawing money, depositing money, and checking their account balance.

Project Structure

ATM.java: Represents the ATM machine class. It contains methods for handling user transactions.
BankAccount.java: Represents the user's bank account class. It stores the account balance and allows for depositing and withdrawing money.
Main.java: Contains the main method to run the ATM system and interact with users.


Features
User Interface: The ATM provides a user-friendly interface for users to interact with the system. It includes options for withdrawing, depositing, and checking the balance.
Transaction Handling: The ATM class implements methods for each transaction option, such as withdraw(amount), deposit(amount), and checkBalance().
Account Management: The BankAccount class manages the user's account balance and provides methods for depositing and withdrawing money.
Input Validation: User input is validated to ensure it is within acceptable limits. For example, sufficient balance is checked before allowing withdrawals.
Feedback Messages: Appropriate messages are displayed to the user based on their chosen options and the success or failure of their transactions.


Usage

To use the ATM system, follow these steps:

Run the Main.java file to start the ATM system.
Follow the prompts on the screen to select your desired transaction (withdraw, deposit, or check balance).
Enter the amount for the transaction and follow any additional prompts as necessary.
Receive feedback messages indicating the success or failure of your transaction.


Future Improvements

Enhanced Security Features: Implement user authentication mechanisms such as PIN or biometric authentication.
Transaction History: Add functionality to keep track of transaction history for users.
Multi-Account Support: Allow users to manage multiple bank accounts through the ATM system.
GUI Interface: Develop a graphical user interface (GUI) for a more intuitive user experience.
Internationalization: Support multiple languages for a more inclusive user base.
